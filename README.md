# **Tic-Tac-Toe Game using MVC**

## Objective
The major objective of this implementation was to use,
* Event Handling
* Use of Model View Control (MVC) architecture

## About Game
* This displays a 3x3 matrix of buttons
* Each player gets a turn to pick a button which is not selected. If the player selects a button that is already selected, the system should ignore that selection and let the user select again until he/she picks a free button.
* The buttons selected by user 1 should be marked with a 1 and that for user 2 is 2.
* User 1 gets the first chance, then user 2 gets the chance, and so on.
* Based on the pick, the game might continue (in which case the other player should get his/her turn) or end with either a win to the current player or a draw. When the game ends the results should be displayed in a different window.
